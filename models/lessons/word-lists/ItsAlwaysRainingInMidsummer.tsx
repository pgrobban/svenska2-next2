        <p>
          When talking about weather, the phrase <i>Det blåser</i> means "It's
          windy." However, <i>blåser</i> is a verb in Swedish and "windy" is an
          adjective in English, so a more literal translation would be "(the
          wind) is blowing".
        </p>
        <p>
          The word "windy" can also be translated to <i>blåsig</i> and the
          phrase <i>Det är blåsigt</i> carries the same meaning as{" "}
          <i>Det blåser</i>.
